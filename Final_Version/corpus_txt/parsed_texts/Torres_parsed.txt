—We study a new content-based method for                                  automatically generated summary (peer) has to be compared the evaluation of text summarization systems without                                 with one or more reference summaries (models). DUC used human models which is used to produce system rankings.                               an interface called SEE to allow human judges to compare The research is carried out using a new content-based evaluation framework called F RESA to compute a variety of                           a peer with a model. Thus, judges give a C OVERAGE score divergences among probability distributions. We apply our                            to each peer produced by a system and the final system comparison framework to various well-established content-based                       C OVERAGE score is the average of the C OVERAGE’s scores evaluation measures in text summarization such as C OVERAGE,                         asigned. These system’s C OVERAGE scores can then be used R ESPONSIVENESS, P YRAMIDS and ROUGE studying their                                  to rank summarization systems. In the case of query-focused associations in various text summarization tasks including generic multi-document summarization in English and French,                          summarization (e.g. when the summary should answer a focus-based multi-document summarization in English and                              question or series of questions) a R ESPONSIVENESS score generic single-document summarization in French and Spanish.                         is also assigned to each summary, which indicates how   Index Terms—Text summarization evaluation, content-based                           responsive the summary is to the question(s). evaluation measures, divergences.
