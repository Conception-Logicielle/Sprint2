Abstract  
Deep learning networks have shown promising                                results in modeling climate  
trends. In this study, we explore Long Short-Term                          Memory (LSTM) networks applied  
to oceanic and atmospheric data to improve                                the accuracy of temperature  
forecasting.

We present a dataset compiled from NOAA sources                            and train multiple network  
architectures. Our results indicate that data                             resolution has a strong impact  
on prediction quality.
