ABSTRACT:  
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) allow for direct communication between  
the human brain and external devices. These systems rely on the precise  
interpretation of neural signals, which can be noisy and difficult to decode.  
In this paper, we present a novel method based on wavelet transformation and  
support vector machines for improved signal classification.

Our experimental results show a 15% improvement in accuracy compared to  
traditional methods. We believe this advancement could facilitate real-time  
control in medical-grade BCIs and prosthetic limbs.

INTRODUCTION  
BCIs have existed for decades but are only now becoming practical due to advances in neural signal...
